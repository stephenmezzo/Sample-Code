Known Issues:


-Multiple uses of the select and drag tools can occasionally produce unexpected results. 
-The straight line and drag tools both call the repaint() method. This can cause images to flicker a bit which can look odd. 


Observations and Notes:

-Several fields from both the GuiPaint.java class and the MouseClass.java class which are not private could be set to private and have accessor/mutator methods written for them. 
-Javadoc commentation could have been added to all fields.
